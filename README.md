This simple game "tic-tac-toe" is a pvp game that can be played by each player changing any empty box to 'x' or 'o'.  Make sure after the first person reveals their first move the next player follows with theirs.  The winner is the player who has 3 of their letters in a straight line (can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) before the opposing player.  To change the box the player whos turn it is just needs to click on the box to reveal their letter.  Make sure whoever x is goes first.
